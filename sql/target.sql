(20121, 'CCR5 receptor is a protein expressed on the surface  of T cells  (and other leukocytes) and acts as a chemokine receptor. It has become a drug target structure since CCR5 is one of the ways that HIV uses to enter and infect host cells. '),

(20123, 'Protease is a type of enzymes that cleaves protein peptide bonds by hydrolysis. Some proteases that are interesting for pharmaceutical purposes are the HIV-1 protease and hepatitis C virus protease, that can both be inhibited by specific PIs (protease inhibitors). '),

(20125, 'Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is an enzyme that oxidizes anion iodide (I-) to iodine (I0) which is an essential step in the synthesis of thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin. It thus leads to reduced production of T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland. '), 
(20126, 'GABAb receptors are metabotropic G-protein receptors that are linked to K+ channels. Upon activation they stimulate the opening of potassium channels which leads to hyperpolarisation. GABAb receptors are thus considered inhibitory receptors.'), 
(20127, 'Endothelin receptors (ET) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors whose activation by endothelin leads to elevation of intracellular calcium. ETa is found on smooth muscles of blood vessels and leads to vasoconstriction. Endothelin is one of the strongest vasoconstrictors.'), 
(20128, 'PDE-3 (phosphodiesterase 3) is highly expressed in the heart and the rest of the cardiovascular system. It cleaves a covalent bond in cAMP and leads to its degradation. PDE-3 inhibitors thus lead to high cAMP levels which then results in increased PKA activity.');
